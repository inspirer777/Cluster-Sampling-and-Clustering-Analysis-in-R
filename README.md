# Cluster Sampling and Clustering Analysis in R

This project involves using different statistical methods such as cluster sampling and clustering analysis in R. We use educational datasets for various analyses and visualize the results of clustering with different methods.

## Required Libraries:
To run this code, you need the following libraries:
- `survey`: For advanced statistical analyses such as cluster sampling.
- `ggplot2`: For graphical plotting.

You can install these libraries using the following commands:
```R
install.packages("survey")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
# Good Luck !
