# Cluster Sampling and Clustering Analysis in R

# 1.R
This project involves using different statistical methods such as cluster sampling and clustering analysis in R. We use educational datasets for various analyses and visualize the results of clustering with different methods.

# 2.R
Statistical Sampling and Variance Analysis in R

Description: This R script provides examples of statistical sampling, variance calculations, and clustering analysis. It includes:

- Calculation of means and variances for one-stage and multi-stage cluster samples.
- Estimation of within-cluster and between-cluster variance.
- Examples from statistical textbooks (e.g., Example 4.5 and Example 7.5) covering real-world cluster sampling methods.
- Creation and manipulation of data frames for further analysis.
- Use of built-in datasets (like starwars) and visualization for exploratory data analysis.
- The code is ideal for statisticians and data scientists working on survey sampling, cluster analysis, and statistical modeling.

## Required Libraries:
To run this code, you need the following libraries:
- `survey`: For advanced statistical analyses such as cluster sampling.
- `ggplot2`: For graphical plotting.

You can install these libraries using the following commands:
```R
install.packages("survey")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
